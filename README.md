Summary: 
Life GPA is an application that allows you to track your adherance to any habit that you input. A user is able to input a habit that they either want to adhere to (good) or avoid (bad), and receive a daily check in. A score, or gpa, is calculated daily from their responses, and the user is able to see their progress over time.
